### Abstract
In this project, we aim to graph a dumbed-down model of heat flow in the Bay Area using
concepts from multivariable calculus. Using data collected from locations in the Bay Area during
four days, we interpolate our data, allowing us to produce a 3D surface allowing us to visualize
the temperature distribution during these few days. We then use this graph to explore what partial
derivatives would mean in this context and the level curves that go along with it.
